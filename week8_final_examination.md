##Final Examination

In order to  ensure the quality of the software system of diandian, we must make a plan and manage the testing of software.

Step1 : Organize a test group(result ->  task book)

Step2 : Create test plan(result ->  test plan)

Step3 : Design and development of test(result -> test specification)

Step4 : Test execution(result -> problem report)

Step5 : Deal with test result and create test report(result -> test report)

###1. Test plan

Testing plan is very important, make sure we create a executable test plan which includes as follow:

(1) Make document of test requirement for diandian, define what to test

(2) Define constraint conditions for software of diandian

(3) Establish the test target and objective of diandian

(4) Establish the test strategy

(5) Start early testing activities

(6) Determining the porject deliverable product

(7) Determining the critical success function of diandian

(8) Risk assessment

(9) Determining the test schedule

(10) Setting up test data requirements document

(11) Define report requirements

(12) Define team tasks and responsibilities
 
(13) Create test plan document
 
(14) Plan and analysis necessary review test readiness

###Test design and development

(1) Determining the test techniques and strategies

(2) Prepare and build test program design standard

(3) Determining the list and level of test programs and test script

(4) Distribute test programs and scripts to the test group members

(5) Design input and expected output of test programs and scripts

(6) Build automatic test script library

###Test implementation and review

(1) Set up development environment and script

(2) Perform testing activities in different stages

(3) Analysis bug and compile the problems report and track defect

(4) Summary data, prepare the test report

(5) Collect and analyze measurement
