##Final Examination

In order to  ensure the quality of the software system of diandian, we must make a plan and manage the testing of software.

Step1 : Organize a test group (result ->  task book)

Step2 : Create test plan (result ->  test plan)

Step3 : Test design and development (result -> test specification)

Step4 : Test execution (result -> problem report)

Step5 : Deal with test result and create test report (result -> test report)

###1. Test plan

Testing plan is very important, make sure we create a executable test plan which includes as follow:

(1) Make document of test requirement for diandian, define what to test

(2) Define constraint conditions for software of diandian

(3) Establish the test target and objective of diandian

(4) Establish the test strategy

(5) Start early testing activities

    we must take part in testing activities when the requirement begin.

(6) Determining the porject deliverable product

    The software of diandian with its funcions defined in the requirement must be implemented.

(7) Determining the critical success function of diandian

(8) Risk assessment

    There will be some risk in our test period, so we must control those risks.

(9) Determining the test schedule

(10) Setting up test data requirements document

    When we begin our test, test data must be designed for our testing activities. For the software of diandian, we must
    
    prepare many words for testing.

(11) Define report requirements

(12) Define team tasks and responsibilities

    Assign task and determine the responsibilities for every members of test group.
 
(13) Create test plan document
 
(14) Plan and analysis necessary review test readiness

###2. Test design and development

(1) Determining the test techniques and strategies

    Automatic test and manual testing

(2) Prepare and build test program standard of design

(3) Determining the list and level of test programs and test script

(4) Distribute test programs and scripts to the test group members

(5) Design input and expected output of test programs and scripts

    Input and output must be designed, those input and its output will be used for testing.

(6) Build automatic test script library

    For automatic test, we must build the automatic script library for diandian.

###3. Test implementation and review

(1) Set up development environment and script

    Test user cases and Define how to test the software of diandian.

(2) Perform testing activities in different stages

    We use automatic script and manual testing methods, I think those methods must consist a mixture.

(3) Analysis bug and compile the problems report and track defect

(4) Summary data, prepare the test report

    The test report is our final report for reviewing our software of diandian, it is very important and will be used for
    
    determing the software of diandian pass the test or not.
    
(5) Collect and analyze measurement

    Finally, we should collect and analyze measurement and determine the software of diandian's quality is ok or not.
    
    How many bugs hand down?
    
    Is it pass the test?
    
    Can it release?
    
    If we answer those questiones, we perhaps finish our test of diandian.
