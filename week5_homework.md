#Formal methods & model checking

As the book say " Although model checking and some other formal analysis techniques have alleviated the problem to some

degree, formal methods in general still remain a costly alternative for ensuring software quality ". In my opinion, formal

methods is useful in some situation. 

1. The type of products or application domains that would benefit from using formal verification and analysis techniques.

2. The type of software artifacts in the above products that can be verified or analyzed by these techniques.

##My understanding of formal methods

- The biggest obstacle to formal methods is the high cost associated with the difficult task of performing these human 
  
   intensive activities correctly without adequate automated support.

- One way to deal with the difficult and human-intensive formal verification activities is through automation and software
  
  tool support. However, the long standing theoretical results state that the correctness and other properties for general

  programs are undecidable problems, that is, there is no hope for algorithmic or fully automated solutions.



##Model checking in particular

- Model checking techniques are gaining popularity in the software engineering research community.

- Model checking combines algorithmic checking of propositions through execution with formal assertions stated as the     

  propositions with respect to software systems modeled as finite-state machines.

- Model checking is a “hot” topic in software engineering research today.
