#Testing VS CMMI

## Testing of Software

Software testing is any activity aimed at evaluating an attribute or capability of a program or system and determining 

that it meets its required results. [Hetzel88] Although crucial to software quality and widely deployed by programmers and 
testers, software testing still remains an art, due to limited understanding of the principles of software. The difficulty 
in software testing stems from the complexity of software: we can not completely test a program with moderate complexity. 

Testing is more than just debugging. The purpose of testing can be quality assurance, verification and validation, or 

reliability estimation. Testing can be used as a generic metric as well. Correctness testing and reliability testing are 

two major areas of testing. Software testing is a trade-off between budget, time and quality.
