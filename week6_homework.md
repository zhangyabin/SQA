#Testing VS SQM

## Testing of Software

- Software testing is any activity aimed at evaluating an attribute or capability of a program or system and determining

  that it meets its required results. [Hetzel88] Although crucial to software quality and widely deployed by programmers
  
  and testers, software testing still remains an art, due to limited understanding of the principles of software. 

- The difficulty in software testing stems from the complexity of software: we can not completely test a program with

  moderate complexity.

- Testing is more than just debugging. The purpose of testing can be quality assurance, verification and validation, or 

  reliability estimation. Testing can be used as a generic metric as well. Correctness testing and reliability testing are

  two major areas of testing. Software testing is a trade-off between budget, time and quality. 


## SQM(Software Quality Management)

The aim of Software Quality Management (SQM) is to manage the quality of software and of its development process.


### Software quality management meaning

Software quality management can be realized in various ways depending on organization and type of realized project, but

it should support whole software development lifecycle, meaning:

- Collecting requirements and defining scope of IT project, focused on verification if defined requirements will be   
  
  testable.

- Designing the solution, focused on planning test process e.g.

- Solution implementation supported by creating test cases and scenarios, executing them and registering defects
  
  including coordination of fixing them.

- Change management, supported by verification how planned changes can influence the quality of created solution and
  
  eventual change of test plan.

- Closing project, supported by realization number of tests focused on complex verification of overall quality of
  
  created solution.
