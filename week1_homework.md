#My Understanding Of SQA

##Concept

- Software quality measures how well software is designed (quality of design), and how well the software conforms to that 

  design (quality of conformance),although there are several different definitions. It is often described as the 'fitness 

  for purpose' of a piece of software.

- Software quality may be defined as conformance to explicitly stated functional and performance requirements, explicitly

  documented development standards and implicit characteristics that are expected of all professionally developed   
  
  software.

###Software product quality

- Correctness
 
- Product quality
  
  . Conformance to requirements or program specification; related to Reliability

- Scalability

- Completeness

- Absence of bugs

- Fault-tolerance

  . Extensibility

  . Maintainability

- Documentation


###Source code quality

- Readability

- Ease of maintenance, testing, debugging, fixing, modification and portability

- Low complexity

- Low resource consumption: memory, CPU

- Number of compilation or lint warnings

- Robust input validation and error handling, established by software fault injection


###Software reliability

- Reliability in program development, Requirements, Design, Programming, Software Build and Deployment, Testing, Runtime


###Software quality factors

- A software quality factor is a non-functional requirement for a software program, Some factors are listed here:
  
  Understandability, Completeness, Conciseness, Portability, Consistency, Maintainability, Testability, Usability, 

  Reliability, Efficiency, Security
